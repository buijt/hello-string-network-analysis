# Hello World! STRING Network Analysis

Exploratory workbook to perform network analysis on proteomics data from scratch (not using dedicated bioinformatics packages for biological network analysis), using edges defined by the [STRING](https://string-db.org/) database.

This repository contains nothing too complex and is a learning exercise.

The proteomic data is derived from the raw DIA data files in [Project PXD047236](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD047236) on PRIDE then searched in [DIA-NN](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN) using an in-silico generated spectral library based on the full human proteome of canonical protein sequences downloaded from the UniProt 2023_04 release.
